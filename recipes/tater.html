        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen cut green beans, thawed</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds frozen tater tots</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's®)</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 small scallions, thinly sliced</li>
     </ul> 
     
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) </li>
        <li>Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and swirl to coat skillet evenly. Add onions to skillet in one even layer; top with ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Cook undisturbed until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir 
            beef and onions until well combined, and cook until beef is cooked through and browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. 
            Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine. Arrange tater tots decoratively 
            over beef mixture in the skillet, avoiding large gaps between tots. </li>  
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about 1 hour. 
            Sprinkle with cheese and scallions; cool 10 minutes before serving. </li>      
     </ol>
